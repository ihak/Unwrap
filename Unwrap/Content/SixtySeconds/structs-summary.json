    "correct": [
        "Structs can have as many or as few properties as you need.",
        "Structs can have custom initializers.",
        "Strings and arrays are both structs.",
        "Methods that change properties must be marked <code>mutating<\/code>",
        "You can share properties and methods across all instances of a struct using <code>static<\/code>",
        "Computed properties let us run code to return a value."

    "wrong": [
        "You may either have stored properties or computed properties, but not both.",
        "Structs may not use constant properties.",
        "You can combine <code>public<\/code> and <code>private<\/code> in a single property.",
        "The <code>self<\/code> keyword must not be used inside initializers.",
        "You must always write your own initializer for structs.",
        "Structs can't have lazy properties."
